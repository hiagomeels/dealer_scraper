Great experience. I found the car I was interested in at
carfax. It was just what was advertised. Everyone was so
helpful. Eric Goodas, Jeremy and Brandon went out of their
way to make me feel at ease. I am very happy with my new
ford escape. Thank you guys.

I recommend McKaig Chevrolet Buick. We decided to request on
a vehicle and they contacted us right away. Go see Mr.
Dennis Smith to help you with your dream car! He was super
patient with all mi kids and being with us until 10pm! We
are from Henderson, TX and definitely was worth the drive! I
appreciate the help we got from Dennis, McCloskey, and
Prickett. They made our purchase so smoothly. I highly
recommend them to my family and friends.
